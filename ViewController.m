In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves improper handling of object ownership and memory management, particularly when dealing with delegates and blocks.  For example, consider a scenario where a view controller (A) sets itself as the delegate of another object (B). If A deallocates before B removes A as its delegate, a dangling pointer (a pointer to memory that has been freed) can occur in B, potentially leading to crashes.
